Golem Hunt
==========

Very crude survival game prototype:
fight skeletons and ancient golems, 
through the fallen ruins, 
on an endless map.

BEWARE: the webgl version does not work with the infinite map, 
maybe the windows version is not that ok with it too :/ 
but at least the later does not crash.
