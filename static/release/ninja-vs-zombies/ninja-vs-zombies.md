Ninja vs. Zombies
=================

A conceptual game based on the theme "contrast", using a ninja,
the colors of japan, our recurrent zombies and an simple but
unusual gameplay for us. The game is mostly 1D, all the actions
depend more on timing than anything else. I was not sure it would
work, but it seems to have quite some potential. As with the
earlier ones it is improbable that we could be able to continue
after the marathon, but it would be nice to see a simple story,
a soundtrack (like the one in the video, which is no it the game),
more attack forms, more enemies with different movements, final
bosses, different levels, better backgrounds, etc. As usual it
was made in C/SDL, but we didn't optimize for speed as much as
the other ones, It was a relaxed development using our earlier
codebase.
