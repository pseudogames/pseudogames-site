An one-flag-CTF-style game developed during SPJAM 2013 game marathon,
Sao Paulo, Brazil, with the main theme "plot twist" and the bonus ones
"head" and "yellow". The plot is that both characters are after the
golden head and the twist is the once in a while change from a dispute
to a cooperation, when the threatening zombie waves come. Besides that
we choose to make a heavily copyright sensitive homage to Indiana Jones,
Allan Quarterman, with graphics from Zelda. As it's not a commercial
game, we hope it fits under fair use; any complaint get in contact with
us through pseudogames-dev at google groups. It was implemented using C
as main language and SDL as graphic library, during the initial 48 hours,
with some late bugfixes the following week. It was originally designed
to be played on an arcade machine with two players.
