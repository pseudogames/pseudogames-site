Betty Boop Tetris

A nice tetris game I did for an ex-girlfriend -- I hope my wife don't get upset if she sees it here. :]

* date: 2006
* platform: C, SDL, Ogg/Vorbis/Theora, GIMP Script
* genre: puzzle

This project has quite some nice touchs:
   - all the resources are compiled within the code and all of them are generated by the makefile, using gimp scripts to export layers, hiding and showing them according to a certain naming convention; 
   - also, if the videos -- that are from the Internet Archive -- are not present on the build dir, they are downloaded, cut, encoded, converted to C code arrays and compiled into one monolithc (static) binary; 
   - it compiles for linux or Windows (SDL / mingw32), into a very clean self-contained application, all (cross-)compiled on my Linux workstation; 
   - even with all the 10 "next level"-videos the zip package were only 3.3M zipped (6Mb uncompressed), thanks to the tight ogg/vorbis/theora compression; 
   - to avoid extra libraries all the images and sprites were encoded on theora videos as well, each sprite or background in a frame -- for the background it were specially good, because all the window could change, but usually only the game board changed, so it combined artistic freedom with lightness of content.
