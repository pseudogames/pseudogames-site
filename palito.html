<h2 class="title">Palito
</h2>
<p>A cute project from the college days,
inspired on Total Annihilation,
Palito (which means "Stick")
is a Real-Time Strategy game
with usability in mind.

Pitty I could not find a stable version
with the heightmap working,
there were quite some beautiful maps
on the style of TA.
