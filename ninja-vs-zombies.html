<h2 class="title">Ninja vs. Zombies
</h2>
<p>A conceptual game based on the theme "contrast", using a ninja, the colors of japan, our recurrent use of zombies and an simple but unusual gameplay for us. The game is mostly 1d, all the actions depend more on timming than anything else. I was not sure it would work, but it seems to have quite some potential. As with the earlier ones it is improbable that we could be able to continue after the marathon, but it would be nice to see a simple story, a soundtrack (like the one in the video), more attack forms, more enemies with different movements, final bosses, different levels, better backgrounds, etc. As usual it was made in C/SDL, but we didn't optimize for speed as much as the other ones, It was a relaxed development using our earlier codebase.
