<h2 class="title">Betty Boop Tetris
</h2>
<p>A nice tetris game I did for an ex-girlfriend &mdash; I hope my wife don't get upset if she sees it here. :]</p>
<p>
	This project has quite some nice touchs:
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>all the resources are compiled within the code and all of them are generated by the makefile, using gimp scripts to export layers, hiding and showing them according to a certain naming convention;</li>
			<li>also, if the videos &mdash; that are from the Internet Archive &mdash; are not present on the build dir, they are downloaded, cut, encoded, converted to C code arrays and compiled into one monolithc (static) binary</li>
			<li>it compiles for linux or Windows (SDL / mingw32), into a very clean self-contained application, all (cross-)compiled on my Linux workstation</li>
			<li>even with all the 10 "next level"-videos the zip package were only 3.3M zipped (6Mb uncompressed), thanks to the tight ogg/vorbis/theora compression</li>
			<li>to avoid extra libraries all the images and sprites were encoded on theora videos as well, each sprite or background in a frame -- for the background it were specially good, because all the window could change, but usually only the game board changed, so it combined artistic freedom with lightness of content.</li>
		</ul>
